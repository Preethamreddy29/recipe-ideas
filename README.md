##Your Personal Kitchen üç≤

This project is a sophisticated, single-page web application designed to be your personalized culinary guide. It helps users discover the perfect recipe by intelligently combining their available ingredients with their personal preferences, all within a sleek and intuitive user interface. This application transforms the often-overwhelming task of deciding what to cook into a seamless, enjoyable, and creative process.

##Project Vision & Design Philosophy

Our core philosophy was to create a user experience that feels both magical and highly personal. We broke down the traditional recipe search process into a guided, step-by-step flow, ensuring the user is never overwhelmed by choices. The design is deliberately minimalist and immersive, using a consistent visual language that elevates the entire experience.

Aesthetic Harmony: The application's visual style is a deliberate blend of modern and cozy. The landing page sets a tranquil mood with its gentle gradient, while the subsequent pages feature a consistent, warm color palette that complements the illustrated kitchen background. The semi-transparent, card-like containers provide a unique "in-app" feel, allowing the background to show through while maintaining perfect text readability.

Intuitive Interaction: Every design choice, from the a-la-carte selection cards to the dynamic carousel, was made to simplify user interaction. The absence of redundant "Next" buttons and the direct-click progression for single-choice selections create a fluid, uninterrupted flow that feels highly responsive and intelligent.

Magical User Journey: The experience is carefully choreographed to feel like a personal culinary journey. From the "Cooking up magic..." loading screen to the final presentation of tailored recipes, the app builds a sense of anticipation and delivers a delightful and personalized result.

##Core Functionality

The application's capabilities are built on a robust architecture that handles user input, API interaction, and dynamic content rendering.

Intelligent Recipe Generation: The heart of the application is its integration with the Google Gemini API. It processes a rich set of user data‚Äîincluding available ingredients, mood, time, and health preferences‚Äîto generate unique, context-aware recipes that go beyond standard search results.

Multi-Step Guided Flow: The user journey is segmented into distinct, logical steps:

Ingredients Input: Users can add and manage a list of available ingredients.

Mood & Time: A quick selection of the user's current mood and available cooking time.

Cravings & Stomach Feel: A refined selection of taste cravings and a preference for how the meal should feel.

Effort & Health Focus: A choice of effort level and dietary preferences (e.g., Low Carb, Plant-Based).

Meal & Notes: The final step to specify the meal type and add any specific dietary notes.

Dynamic Recipe Display: After a brief loading period, the application presents the generated recipes in an elegant carousel. Users can browse through the cards, each a snapshot of a unique recipe with key stats. Clicking on a card transitions to a detailed view with a full ingredient list, step-by-step instructions, and nutritional information.

Comprehensive User Feedback: The application is designed to be communicative. It provides a visual loading screen during the API call and delivers clear, actionable error messages if a recipe cannot be generated, ensuring the user is never left in the dark.

Technology Stack
This project was developed using a modern and efficient technology stack, showcasing best practices in web development.
