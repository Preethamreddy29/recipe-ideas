Your Personal Kitchen üç≤
This is a modern, single-page web application that helps users discover the perfect recipe by combining their available ingredients with their personal preferences. The application transforms the often-overwhelming task of deciding what to cook into a simple, enjoyable, and creative process.

The app's design is minimalist and immersive, guiding users through a seamless, step-by-step flow with a consistent visual language.

Core Features
Intelligent Recipe Generation: Powered by the Google Gemini API, the app generates unique recipes based on a rich set of user inputs.

Intuitive Multi-Step Flow: The user journey is broken down into a series of logical steps, including ingredient input, mood, time, and health preferences. Each step is presented on a separate page for a focused and clean UI.

Dynamic UI: The background transitions from a calming gradient to a vibrant, illustrated kitchen. The cards are semi-transparent, allowing the background to show through while maintaining perfect text readability.

Interactive Design: The interface uses visually appealing cards and fluid animations. Clicking an option on a card automatically advances the user to the next step, creating a highly responsive and intelligent flow.

Recipe Carousel: The final recipe options are displayed in a modern, elegant carousel. Users can easily scroll through suggestions and select a recipe for a detailed view.

Robust Error Handling: The application provides clear, custom error messages if the API is unable to generate a valid recipe from the given inputs.

Technology Stack
React: For a component-based architecture and efficient state management.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling, enabling a consistent and scalable design.

Google Gemini API: Utilized for its powerful generative capabilities to create unique and personalized recipe content.
